# Covid-19-Prediction-Analysis-with-System-Dynamics
Using Vensim PLE software, I build a model of the Covid 19 outbreak. I apply systems thinking throughout the model to make predictions. I later apply hypothetical scenarios to gain a better understanding of pandemic systems.


1.short recovery duration means shortlived and volitile outburst
2.vaccine ensures no secondary wave
3.more non severe cases means more infected at a time
4.breaking hospital capacity leads to a massive stiletto in deaths
